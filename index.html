									<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dirkgorissen" class="icon brands fa-linkedin"><span class="label" style="">LinkedIn</span></a>
								</header>
									<p>I have worked on a very wide variety of projects, with a wide variety of technologies, organisations, and domains. From machine learning and drone design in aerospace, to advising governments on open data policy, negotiating complex commercial licencing deals, and speaking at major international conferences.</p>

									<p>This has required building a very flexible set of skills in addition to my solid technical foundation. I enjoy connecting and learning about different domains and find Im good at communicating and tranlating ideas and quick to pick up new things. </p>

									<blockquote>What motivates me is not technology itself, but putting technology to work with a real, demonstrable, commercial or social impact.</blockquote>

									<p>Over the years I have built up a considerable amount of international collaborative experience. I have worked in  research labs in Belgium, Poland, South Africa, USA, Canada, and the United Kingdom.</p>
									
									<p>In addition, my passion for solving real, practical problems has given me the privilege to work with a wide range of institutions and industrial partners, including: Rolls-Royce, Freescale, BMW, Arcelor Mittal, NXP Semiconductors, Airbus, CISRO Austrailia, BAE Systems, RWTH Aachen, University of Cambridge, The World Bank, and many others I am unable to name.</p>

									<h2>About</h2>
									<p>Runaway academic</p>
									<p>Computer Science and AI</p>
									<p>Driven by impact</p>
								</header>
								<p>Born and raised in the heart of Africa I went on to study Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, and obtain a PhD in Computational Engineering. Driven by the need to be closer to impact I left academia to work in commercial R&D labs as well as in various startups covering drone technology, data science, machine learning, and self driving cars.</p>
								
								<p>Over time I extended my technical background with significant commercial experience and found my sweet spot where deep technology meets real world impact. I currently work as Product Manager for Oxford spin-out and Autonomous Driving Software company Oxbotica.</p>
									
								<p>Outside of work I have been very active in the Tech community. I have (co)organised multiple meetups in London, been an active speaker, and I have always strived to work on projects that have some wider use to society: I have worked on access to water supply in rural Africa, used flying radar to locate landmines, built a drone based tracking system to search for Orangutans in central Borneo, been an active STEM Ambassador in schools, co-founded the UK Association of Research Software Engineers, and tried to do my bit to quantify the plastic pollution problem in the oceans.</p>
								
								<p>With whatever time is left I tinker with electronics and robots at home, head into nature, hit the heavy bag, or find an icy lake to go swimming in.</p>

													<strong>CLARE</strong>, short for Come Look At Robot Entertainment, is an interactive robot I
														designed together with the kids and am have been working on for quite some time on the side. Its
														mostly for fun and to expose the kids to robotics but also allows me to scratch that technical itch
														as my professional life ventures into documents, spreadsheets, powerpoint, and meetings.
												</p>
													
													<p>
														I designed CLARE fully from scratch, including all CAD, wiring, coding, and even some custom
														PCBs. Its printed on my home 3D printer and features multiple cameras, face detection and
														tracking, interactive voice commands, LCD screen, LEDs, and fart detector. It can be controlled
														with an RC remote or (eventually) move autonomously using SLAM.

														grew out of the frustration of dealing with Excel spreadsheets as part of the UAV (drone) design
														workflow. They were platform dependent, hard to automate and parallellise. The result was a
														compiler
														that could take an excel spreadsheet we used for aircraft sizing and compile it into stand alone
														python
														code for running on our cluster.

													<p>This work was a collaboration with the <a href="http://www.aic.ecs.soton.ac.uk/">Agents,

														Bayesian
														framework to analyse an individual’s mobility patterns and identify departures from routine.
														It
														is
														able to detect both spatial and temporal departures from routine based on heterogeneous
														sensor
														data
														(GPS, Cell Tower, social media, ..) and outperforms existing state-of-the-art predictors.
